    "Complete an exploratory data analysis by reviewing the data, identifying potential issues in the dataset, and checking for strong correlations between any columns and the target. You can explore the data in SageMaker Data Wrangler and in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, spend time reviewing the following items:\n",
    "- **Column histograms**: Review the columns in a visual format and check what kinds of values are in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Quick model**: Review the dataset and think about an expected model outcome.\n",
    "- **Feature correlation**: Check if there is strong correlation between any columns and the target.\n",
    "- **Target leakage**: Check if there is any data that is dependent on the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening SageMaker Data Wrangler opens new tab in SageMaker Studio. To follow these directions, use one of the following options:\n",
    "- **Option 1:** View the tabs side by side. To create a split screen view from the main SageMaker Studio window, either drag the **capstone.ipynb** tab to the side or choose (right-click) the **capstone.ipynb** tab and choose **New View for Notebook**. You can now have the directions visible as you work with the SageMaker Data Wrangler flow.\n",
    "- **Option 2:** Switch between the SageMaker Studio tabs to follow these instructions. When you are finished exploring the SageMaker Data Wrangler steps, return to the notebook by choosing the **capstone.ipynb** tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get a **\"The following instance type is not available: ml.m5.4xlarge. Try selecting a different instance below.\"** error when creating a new flow file, you can choose another instance type. Try the **ml.m5.8xlarge** next.\n",

    "If the message **An error occurred loading this view** displays, close the **untitled.flow** tab and reopen the flow file from the file browser.\n",

    "**Hint 1**: There are many ways to explore the dataset. Open a SageMaker Data Wrangler flow to get started. You need both the **claims.csv** and **customers.csv** imported into SageMaker Data Wrangler from the S3 bucket that contains **databucket-** in its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2**: To import a second table, return to your **Data flow**, then choose the **Import** tab to import another dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3**: **Get data insights** and **Add analysis** are two ways to explore data in SageMaker Data Wrangler. After you review some sample charts from your data, you can use other plotting tools in the notebook to analyze the data if you want to. The **plt** and **sns** libraries have been installed. Feel free to use any analysis tools that you are familiar with to explore the dataset.  \n",
